# CAMulator_Figures

This repository contains figure generation scripts and Jupyter notebooks for the **CAMulator** publication. **CAMulator** is a machine-learning-based emulator of the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6), designed to provide fast and accurate climate simulations.

## 📌 About
This repository is specifically for generating figures related to the **CAMulator** study and its evaluation. If you are looking for the **CAMulator** model itself, please refer to the main repository (**[Insert Link to CAMulator Model Repository]**).

## 📊 Figures Overview
The notebooks in this repository generate key figures from the **CAMulator** study, including:
- **Model climatology comparisons** (CAMulator vs. CAM6)
- **Modes of climate variability** (ENSO, NAO, PNA)
- **Precipitation and temperature biases**
- **Extreme events and variability**
- **+2K and +4K SST warming response**
- **Global conservation properties (mass, moisture, and energy)**

## 📜 How to Use
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The required dependencies can be installed using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If applicable, include a `requirements.txt` file in your repository with necessary Python packages.)*

### Running the Notebooks
To generate the figures, clone the repository and run the notebooks:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CAMulator_Figures.git
cd CAMulator_Figures/Figure_Notebooks
jupyter notebook
```
Open the relevant notebook and run the cells to generate the figures.

## 🏗 Future Work
